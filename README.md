# arduinoGPS_NEO6M
Inspired by the potential for change, I pursued a GIS degree. In a team with Khuram and Waqas, we embarked on a project fusing Arduino and GPS tech. Our journey involved intense Arduino learning, extensive research, and coding challenges. A breakthrough came, and we successfully harnessed NMEA data from satellites.
